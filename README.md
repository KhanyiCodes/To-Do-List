### Features:
- **Add new tasks**
- **Mark tasks as complete**
- **Delete tasks**
- **Display tasks in two lists**: "To-Do" and "Completed"
- **Server communication** using `fetch()` for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

- **Backend**: (Expected) Server API for handling tasks (assumed `/api/tasks` endpoints)
